The Owls Are Not What They Seem


This is a game of memory built for 2 players with jquery, javascript, css3, html5. The premise of the game is to find matching images and make more matches than your opponent. The images are randomized with a random.Math function so they show up in different spots every time. The player alternates based on a when matches are not made.  HTML5 holds all of the elements, CSS3 styles with floats, and positioning for mobile responsivity, though game is best played on a screen larger than 800px. 

Issues mostly occur when the squares are clicked too fast and there's not enough time to process if two match before a third square is clicked. 

Next steps for this project would be to add in more animation on win, and track winners for rounds - holding that data true when you refresh the board, and of course, refactoring the code further so that it is shorter. 


This game is based on the early 1990s tv show, Twin Peaks. The owls are a motif in the second season of the show.
